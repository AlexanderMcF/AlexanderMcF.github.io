    <h1>Potential Areas of Improvement</h1>
		<h2>Adding an IP Allowed List </h2>
			<h3> Areas of the CIA triad affected: Confidentiality</h3>
			<p>To keep your website confidential, we recommend utilizing an IP allowed list, also known as a "whitelist." 
			This can help ensure that only authorized users have access to the website you have created.</p>

        <h2>Utilizing Backups</h2>
            <h3>Areas of the CIA triad affected: Integrity, Availability </h3>
                <p>Backups are incredibly important to have in the event of data loss. 
                By utilizing backups, you ensure that your webserver has minimum downtime in the event of an
                attack or system failure. By utilizing backups, you ensure that the data is both readily available
                to access and maintain the integrity of the data that could've been potentially lost. </p>
				<p>How often you use backups is dependent on the type of webserver you have and how impactful any amount
				of potential downtime might be to the service you are providing. </p>
